        Sunglasses are a visual aid, variously termed spectacles or glasses, which feature lenses that are coloured or darkened to prevent strong light from reaching the eyes. In outdoor activity like riding, skiing and flying, the eye can receive more light than usual. It has been recommended to wear these kind of glasses whenever outside to protect the eyes from ultraviolet raditation, which can lead to the development of a cataract. Sunglasses can improve visual comfort and visual clarity by protecting the eye from glare. So if you may sometimes find yourself driving down the road, sun shining in your eyes, as you search in vain for those clip on or magnetically attached sun lenses that came with your prescription eyeglasses. At times like these, you might find that prescription sunglasses are much more convenient and more than worth the additional investment.<br>
